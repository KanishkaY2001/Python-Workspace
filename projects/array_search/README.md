# Package Details

* Array Searching Algorithms
    * Linear Search
        * Time Complexity: O(n)
        * Sequentially searches the array until element is found
    * Binary Search
        * Time Complexity: O(logn)
        * Divides search space logarithmically until element is found
        * Requires a sorted array
    * Jump Search          
        * Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
        * Jumps and searches the array in blocks until element is found
        * Requires a sorted array
    * Interpolation Search  
        * Time Complexity: O(n)
        * Binary search method to probe the position of the element
        * Requires a uniformly distributed sorted array
